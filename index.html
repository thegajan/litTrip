            <li class="content 1 visible">After a long school year Vy, Travis, and myself have decided to take a trip
                all
                around California and a
                little bit of Arizona and Nevada. Along the way, we will stop at Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
                Arizona, Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, and Sacramento in that order. Throughout the trip we will be visiting
                many iconic and diverse sights which will open our eyes. We have all gathered at Travis’s house and use
                his car as transportation for our trip. Bon Voyage! <br>
                <img src="images/new-adventure.jpg" id="adventure">
            </li>
            <li class="invisible 2 content">It’s been so long since Gajan, Travis and I have had a road trip together,
                so I’ve
                been really looking forward to this one. Our first stop, Santa Cruz! I loved being able to feel the warm
                summer breeze against my face while standing on the beach. Once we finished marveling at the beautiful
                ocean view and the way the waves would softy wash up on the shore, we all decided to go in for a swim,
                and we were so surprised at how “warm” the water was. After a short while of swimming and attempting to
                surf the small ocean waves, we decided to go onto the boardwalk and ride the roller coasters they had.
                This way, we could have the full boardwalk experience. I especially enjoyed the rides, and we even went
                on the Giant Dipper three times because it was the fastest and most exhilarating ride there! In between
                rides, we would search the gift shops for any souvenirs to keep and grabbed some food and snacks on our
                way to the next ride. This was definitely not one of the smartest ideas we have had since the food felt
                like it was rising back up to our chests again during the rides! It might not have been the smartest
                idea, but the chocolate dipped bananas were absolutely worth having during the hot summer afternoon.
                Overall, we had a great time in Santa Cruz for the few hours we spent there, and it felt so nice to
                finally get out of town again.
            </li>
            <li class="content 3 invisible">On the second day of our road and we were in the lovely town of Santa
                Barbara. We got in late the night before and fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillows. We
                started our morning off by walking down to the beach and sat on the sand drinking hot chocolate and
                coffee as we watched the hoards of surfers attempting to catch waves. After hanging out there for a bit,
                we decided to go and get breakfast which turned out to be much needed as we had not eaten much since our
                departure from Santa Cruz almost a day before. After we were full and satisfied, we decided to try our
                luck and visit some of Santa Barbara's attractions. Our first stop was the Old MIssion Santa Barbara.
                None of were especially interested in this attraction but we only had one day in Santa Barbara and we
                wanted to try our luck at visiting various attractions. I have to admit, I didn’t have high
                expectations, but I was reasonably impressed. Vy on the other hand was quite interested in learning all
                about the mission and its history and wanted to stay longer. After a few hours there, we decided to
                finish off our day, we had to leave by dinner time, by stopping by the Santa Barbara County Courthouse
                Like the Old Mission, we weren’t really sure what to expect, but when planning our trip, we heard that
                it might be an interesting place to visit anyways. When we got there it was just closing which we were
                okay with as we didn’t have much time left anyway. But, we decided to make the most out of our trek by
                spending what few hours we had left at the beach that was conveniently across the street. After the
                beach, we finished off our time in Santa Barbara by grabbing dinner and then continuing our trek by
                driving to LA.
            </li>
            <li class="content 4 invisible">
                <h2>Hollywood:</h2>
                Getting to LA from Santa Barbara was stressful due to the heavy LA traffic.
                Unfortunately we got in pretty late and as a result, didn’t get as much sleep as we had originally
                wanted. Nevertheless, the third day of our trip was very exciting as we got to visit Hollywood. This was
                the first time any of us had been there before. I’ll have to admit, I definitely thought the Hollywood
                sign would be a lot cooler than it actually was. Out of the three of us, I think I was the most
                interested in visiting Hollywood. That’s not to say Travis and Gajan didn’t want to go but I could tell
                they were more interested in the basketball game we had planned on going to that night. That being said,
                they trekked around with me all day and didn't complain too much when I asked to stop and observe
                various parts and take pictures. One of our favorite parts collectively was visiting the Hollywood walk
                of fame. Just the whole atmosphere and culture that’s presented in that area was amazing and although we
                all weren’t really sure what to expect, we had a very nice time exploring Hollywood and all it had to
                offer.
                <h2>Staples Center:</h2>
                After spending all day in Hollywood and having been nearly halfway through our trip, we were very tired.
                That being said, before the trip began, Gajan and I had talked about how cool it would be to see Kobe
                Bryant play in a game at Staples center in his final season. Without even thinking, we bought three
                tickets in advance. Not wanting to squander this opportunity, we decided to go against the will of over
                tired bodies and went anyways. Now this game was exciting for more than just the fact that Kobe Bryant
                was playing one of the final games of his career in that the team visiting was none other than our very
                own Golden State Warriors. The Warriors put on a show and exhibited to both Laker’s and (few) Warrior’s
                fans there why they were the best team in basketball at the time. The final score was 112-93 in favor of
                the Golden State Warriors. Looking backI think I can speak for all of us when I say that that was truly
                was a special night because we got to see our home team, The Warriors, win as well as celebrate one of
                the final games played by one of the top basketball players of all.
            </li>
            <li class="content 5 invisible">Day four of our trip was probably one of the most fun do to the fact that we
                went to disneyland. I had only been there a few times when I was young while neither Vy nor Gajan had
                been there at all. Lucky for us, we went during the middle of the week so the lines weren’t long at all.
                We spent nearly all day in the park going on as many rides as we could. I think we went on about twenty
                rides total, some more than once. Even though they were all fun, I particularly enjoyed Space Mountain
                the most. The fast, twisting roller coaster in the dark was so adrenaline pumping and exciting. Gajan on
                the other hand really enjoyed Thunder Mountain Railroad and Vy enjoyed It’s A Small World. After going
                on as many rides as we could before dinner, we decided to leave the park to go shopping and have dinner
                in downtown Disney. While in downtown Disney, we were all able to to buy souvenirs for both ourselves
                and our family members. At the end of the day, we headed back to our hotel, tired and exhausted and went
                to bed early so that we could be well rested for the next leg of our journey.
            </li>
            <li class="content 6 invisible">We approached day five with open minds and being willing to go with the
                flow, or wherever our journey decided to take us. Originally, the plan was to leave LA and drive to
                Phoenix Arizona to watch the College Football Championship game, much to Vy’s oblige. However, upon
                leaving LA early in the morning, we weren’t sure if we would make it in time. Luckily, we made it just
                by the skin of our teeth and managed to get into the stadium before it got too hectic. Of all the
                college football championships that we could’ve gone to, this one was definitely worth both our time and
                money. The game was played between Alabama and Clemson. Clemson was the number one ranked team, but
                Alabama, the number two ranked, was favored to win. This game did not disappoint. Even though she won’t
                admit it, I know for a fact that I caught Vy more than one time enjoying herself and deeply invested in
                the game. The final quarter was probably the most exciting because just as it looked like Alabama was
                going to run away with it, the Clemson Tigers made a quick comeback. the only reason Alabama ended up
                winning was due to the late game heroics of their star running back. Looking back on this game, I don’t
                think I would’ve traded going for any other game.
            </li>
            <li class="content 7 invisible">Since we were already in Arizona and we were heading to Lake Tahoe, we
                decided to take a detour and visit the Grand Canyon. I was fortunate to have seen it before, but for
                Travis and Vy, this was a new experience. I watched as Travis and Vy took in just how enormous this huge
                natural chasm was and the extent of its beauty. I remember the first time I came I didn’t have high
                expectations. Sure we’ve all grown up seeing pictures of it and studying it, but until you see it in
                person, it’s just hard to fathom how amazing the Grand Canyon truly is.After we took our picture in
                front of the the Grand Canyon sign, we checked out the gift shop and walked around a bit and then got
                back in the car and continued our journey.
            </li>
            <li class="content 8 invisible">Due to 2015’s miserable ski season and El Niño this year, we could not avoid
                Lake Tahoe and its plethora of winter sports. We chose to ski at Squaw Valley, an iconic resort known
                for holding the Winter Olympics in 1960. Travis loves to snowboard and I love to ski, but Vy does
                prefers neither. So Vy stayed at base camp and explored the many off mountain activities available at
                the resort, while Travis and I hit the slopes. There was tons of fresh powder and conditions were
                beautiful for a full day of skiing. Travis and I made sure to hit up all of Squaw’s famous slopes, such
                as its Palisades run and Granite Chief. After a wonderful day of skiing Travis and I had covered much of
                the mountain, but were extremely tired and sore. We stayed the night at Squaw and left the next morning
                to complete the last leg of our trip the Sacramento.
            </li>
            <li class="content 9 invisible">On the final leg of our trip, Vy, Travis, and I visited our state's capital.
                In Sacramento, we visited the Capitol Building and explored the beautiful architecture that it imposes.
                After visiting the capitol building we went to the California Railroad Museum where we saw many old
                locomotives which were used during the height of the Union Pacific Railroad. In addition to physical
                trains, the museum provided information on California’s role in connecting the nation through the
                railroad system. Lastly, we visited Sutter’s Fort in order to see the place that started the Gold Rush.
                It was very interesting to see Sutter's Fort, and it looked completely authentic despite the restoration
                efforts that have been made. After a long trip, we were all happy to arrive home and get ready for
                school.
